        <img src="a1.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>My journey in data began with a bachelor’s degree in Communications Technology Engineering, where I first encountered the complex world of data transmission and its applications. Inspired to go further, I pursued a graduate course in big data analytics, where I gained hands-on experience in collecting, preparing, analyzing, and visualizing data to reveal actionable insights.

Now, I specialize in transforming complex data into clear strategies for growth. I streamline processes, uncover trends, and support decision-making that drives real impact.
Data isn’t just about numbers—it’s about discovery, clarity, and making a difference for the teams and businesses.</p>
